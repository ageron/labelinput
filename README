= Introduction =

LabelInput is a javascript tool which adds a label inside your text or password
inputs.  This label automatically disappears when the input is not empty.
The style can be changed as needed very easily.

You can try it out by opening any HTML in the test directory in your browser.


= Compatibility =
Should work in any recent Javascript-compatible browser.

Tested on:
- Iceweasel 3.0.6


= Installation =

1. Download prototype.js (www.prototypejs.org) or use the included copy.

2. Copy prototype.js, labelinput.js and your prefered labelinput CSS stylesheet
   (such as labelinput_blue.css) in the same directory as your HTML file, or in
   the appropriate location within your project (for example, in a "public"
   directory).

3. Include protype.js and labelinput.js in the <head> section of your HTML
   code:

    <script src="prototype.js"  type="text/javascript"></script>
    <script src="labelinput.js" type="text/javascript"></script>

   Fix the paths if these files are not in the same directory as the HTML file.

4. Also include your prefered css stylesheet to your HTML code:
     <link href="labelinput_blue.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />

   You may tweak the CSS to your liking, of course.


= Usage =

1. Add the "labelinput" class to the text or password inputs that you wish to
   label, and set the label using the "value" attribute:

   <input class="labelinput" id="lgn" name="lgn" value="Your login"></input>
   <input class="labelinput" id="pwd" name="pwd" value="Your password"></input>

2. If you want a labelled input to be selected automatically when the page
   loads, simply add the "autofocus" class:

   <input class="labelinput autofocus" [...]></input>


3. If you want a labelled input to be required, simply add the "required"
   class:

   <input class="labelinput required" [...]></input>

   If the input is left empty, the user will not be able to submit the form.
   Instead, all empty and required inputs will be turned to red (tweak the
   "labelinput_error" class in the CSS to change the style as you wish) and
   the first empty and required input will automatically get the focus.

   Note that if a labelled input is not required and if it is left empty, its
   value will be automatically set to "" (empty string) before it is submitted.

= Known issues and future enhancements =

- Testing is needed in many browsers
- An event should be triggered when a required input is left empty and the form
  is submitted. This could be useful if the user wants to display an error
  message for example.
- The autofocus and required functionnality should perhaps be extracted to
  their own javascript file. One may one one functionnality and not the others.
